# Problem 1
StringApp.java: Modifyied Programming Project 3, Phase 1, Problem 1, so that instead of accepting user input, it accepts the input from a data file. Also, instead of writing the input to the screen, the program should write the output to a data file. For	every String that is read in error,	have the program log that error	(String	that caused the	problem	and	the	line number of the offending statement. Store the errors in	a file called error.log.

StringTooLongException: This exception gets thrown if the user enters a string which has 20 or more characters. (see also: StringApp.java)
